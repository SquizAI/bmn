# Spawn Agent Team for Build Phase

Create an agent team for a specific build phase with the appropriate specialized agents.

Based on the build phase specified, create a team with the right agents:

**Phase 1 (Foundation)**: server-architect + database-engineer + observability-engineer (parallel Week 1), then auth-security + realtime-engineer (parallel Week 2), then ai-agent-engineer (Week 3)

**Phase 2 (Skills)**: skill-builder (builds all 7 skills sequentially)

**Phase 3 (Frontend)**: frontend-engineer + test-engineer

**Phase 4 (Business)**: payments-engineer + integrations-engineer (parallel)

**Phase 5 (Launch)**: devops-engineer + test-engineer + marketing-site-engineer (parallel)

After spawning, create tasks from the BUILD-GUIDE for that phase and assign them to teammates.

Usage: /spawn-team <phase-number>
Example: /spawn-team 1
