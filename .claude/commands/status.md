# Project Status

Check the current build status of Brand Me Now v2.

Scan the project directory and report:
1. Which build phases are complete (directories and key files exist)
2. Which build phases are in progress (partial files)
3. Which build phases haven't started
4. Any issues detected (missing dependencies, broken imports, lint errors)
5. Next recommended action based on the BUILD-GUIDE critical path

Cross-reference against docs/prd/BUILD-GUIDE.md to determine completion status.
